# HDV-LIG14

The HDV-LIG14 dataset encompasses 16384 folding sequences generated using the SPOT-RNA algorithm [1]. The goal of this data is to allow the development of machine learning algorithm to better determine the efficiency in self-cleavage and ligation of a given RNA sequence for the HDV-LIG14.

HDV-LIG14 whole sequences as 14 specifics nucleotide that were modified and are illustrated following the IUPAC nucleotide code [2].

The "git" folder hold the code used to launch the algorithm and organize the workspace on GitHub. After each batch of 100 generated, it check for any missing data and regenerate these when missing. Then, it upload to GitHub in batch of 50, to not exceed the 100MB upload limit.  
  
## Machine Learning Outputs V1

![](/media/nt_prediction.png)  

This graph was generated using the testing set, in other words, the data that was not used for training the Machine Learning (ML) model. On the graph, an exact prediction would be situated on a diagonal line represented by the equation Y = X. Where the X-axis represent the estimated output generated by the ML model, while the Y-axis represent the true output taken from experimental data. As we can observed from the above graphical output, all prediction on the diagonal are correct predictions. However, most data points are outlier. Meaning that the true correlation is hidden somewhere else, perhaps, in the various fold of the whole RNA sequence. The machine learning model was saved as a "pickle" file, in the "pkl" folder, under the name "nt_MachineLearning.pkl".
