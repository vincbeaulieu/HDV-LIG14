# HDV / LIG - Lib14

The Lib14 dataset encompasses 16384 folding sequences generated using the SPOT-RNA algorithm [1]. The goal of this data is to allow the development of machine learning algorithm to better determine the efficiency in self-cleavage and ligation of a given RNA sequence for the HDV-Lib14 and LIG-Lib14, respectively.

Both Lib14 sequences have each 14 specific nucleotides that were experimentally modified. Both whole sequence follows the IUPAC nucleotide code to illustrate non-singleton nucleotide modifications [2].

This graph was generated using the testing set, in other words, the data that was not used for training the Machine Learning (ML) model. On the graph, an exact prediction would be situated on a diagonal line represented by the equation Y = X. Where the X-axis represent the estimated output generated by the ML model, while the Y-axis represent the true output taken from experimental data. All prediction on the diagonal are correct predictions. The machine learning model was saved as a "pickle" file, in the "pkl" folder, under the name "hdv_nt_MachineLearning.pkl".
