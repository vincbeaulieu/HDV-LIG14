## Name:  
batch - SPOT_RNA auto-generator and Git auto-upload in batch sequences  
  
## Synopsis:  
sh batch.sh [batch_size] [stating_index]  
  
## Description:  
SPOT_RNA auto-generator, with batch_size and starting sequence number as inputs. After every generated batch, missing data, if any, are solved, and all the generated data from the SPOT_RNA algorithm is uploaded to GitHub in batch of 50, to not exceed the 100MB upload limit.  
  
## Options:  
Does not take any options.  
  
## Examples:  
$ sh batch.sh 100 0  
> Generating batch/size_100/BATCH_SEQUENCE_0  
> Generating batch/size_100/BATCH_SEQUENCE_100  
> Generating batch/size_100/BATCH_SEQUENCE_200  
> ...  
> Generating batch/size_100/BATCH_SEQUENCE_16300  
  
## Bugs:  
- Ending_index is set to 16383. The program does not take ending index as argument yet. Therefore, the value must be changed in the code itself (batch.sh - line 19) for custom ending index.  
- Please raise an issue to report any other bugs or desired features
