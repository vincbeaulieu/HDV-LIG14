# HDV / LIG - Lib14

The Lib14 dataset encompasses 16384 folding sequences generated using the SPOT-RNA algorithm [1]. The goal of this data is to allow the development of machine learning algorithm to better determine the efficiency in self-cleavage and ligation of a given RNA sequence for the HDV-Lib14 and LIG-Lib14, respectively.

The HDV-LIG14 whole sequences as 14 specifics nucleotide that were modified and are illustrated following the IUPAC nucleotide code [2].

## Machine Learning Outputs V1

![](ML/media/nt_prediction.png)  

This graph was generated using the testing set, in other words, the data that was not used for training the Machine Learning (ML) model. On the graph, an exact prediction would be situated on a diagonal line represented by the equation Y = X. Where the X-axis represent the estimated output generated by the ML model, while the Y-axis represent the true output taken from experimental data. As we can observed from the above graphical output, all prediction on the diagonal are correct predictions. However, most data points are outliers. Meaning that the true correlation is hidden somewhere else, perhaps, in the various fold of the whole RNA sequence. The machine learning model was saved as a "pickle" file, in the "pkl" folder, under the name "nt_MachineLearning.pkl".
